# Opacity (Open Password Utility)
## A command line tool for creating and storing strong and secure passwords


You'll notice that there's not much here. Well, I just started this project to learn c++ more deeply.
Feel free to fix all of my awful college habits, we aren't often taught best practices...

## Usage
$ opacity (optional)<len>
-------------------------
Supplying no arguments will create a password of length 15
Minimum password length is 8, while maximum is 63

ex: opacity 24

output - "This is your new password: 5=0p3sK2r4w6o%C*-U1y_vN$"
